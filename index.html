    <h1>The Party is Over</h1>
    <p>Everyone has been singing the glory that is getting a job as a software developer. Go do a bootcamp, get the certification, and walk into a role starting at Â£50k a year. Roll out of bed at 10am, join a 15 minute call, then type some stuff into VS Code from a Jira ticket.</p>
    <p>They weren't wrong. The industry has been desperate for more hands on keyboards for over a decade, and the fact it was one of the few roles borderline-unaffected by the pandemic gave everyone an excuse. That was 4 years ago. When're you going home?</p>
    <h2>Please Go Home</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a moderately experienced software developer. You've spent the last 3-7 years working in offices, usually either in a basement or attic, 
      solving problems for a business while trying to meet wild expectations. You're a far cry from the idealised world of 
    FAANG silicon valley programmers, but you get free fruit and people on the whole want to keep you happy without giving you a payrise.
    You've gotten to grips with the transition from either being a student or a self-taught developer who kept the bug for programming,
    and have just about figured out how to work with the mix of overly-enthusiastic juniors and disinterested seniors.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, you're taking a chair and a monitor home with you because the world looks like it's ending, but the business has to keep making money.
    Between furiously refreshing the BBC news homepage and sitting up waiting for a floppy-haired man to say something stupid, you're continuing to do your work.
    On the whole, this seems like it's been a bit of a net-positive. Suddenly your Head of Agile is really far away from you, you're able to quietly work
    on that bug that's been plaguing you around your normal work for the last 9 months, and you've not heard a dumb sales idea in weeks.</p>
    <p>The business assures you that they're determined to look after their people in this uncertain time. Stipends are given out from the fruit bowl budget
    for you to make your home office slightly less of a Health and Safety nightmare. Everyone tacitly agrees you maybe don't need cameras on before
    midday and it turns out pairing might actually be easier when you're not both crouched around a screen. You hear from friends in other industries having trouble
    and you awkwardly confess that your SaaS employer might actually be doing better than before.</p>
    <h2>Retrain in Cyber</h2>
    <p>Suddenly the government seems to decide that people retraining to work in the software industry is a great solution to the
    "We don't want people starving to death" problem. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/ballet-dancer-could-reskill-with-job-in-cyber-security-suggests-uk-government-ad">Widely-mocked adverts are thrown up</a> but part of you wonders if this is a good thing.
    For years now it has felt like there haven't been enough people, certainly not enough different people, and maybe this will finally give software development the kick it needs to start innovating again.</p>
    <p>Almost overnight it feels like the idea of a "bootcamp developer" goes from that thing you'd hear about happening in places like London
    for big agencies, to something happening all over the country. Your hiring manager and you are innundated with resumes that actually seem really hot compared to the
    past - simple and terse, people just looking for that break into software development. It might even remind you of your own entry into the industry.</p>
    <p>You bring them into the company, and the energy and enthusiasm brings a much needed spark back to the work. On the whole, their code isn't great,
    but it shows potential. It reminds you of most Junior devs you've worked with, including yourself. You have a bit of a laugh about the fact they're earning twice
    what you did when you started - after all, we're much more desperate and flush with cash now! Their soft skills are also leagues beyond most developers you
    have in the team, with them seemingly able to chitchat easily with anyone from other departments - getting all the scuttlebutt that's usually not on development's radar.</p>
